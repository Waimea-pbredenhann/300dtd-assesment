## Design, Development and Testing Log

### 17/05/2024

Today I have been working on the development and design of the possible layout of how the interface of the website will work.

I have created two possible layouts for how the users will use the websites interface. There are 2 possible layouts. The first layout operates as a typical website, where users load into the homepage first before taking any actions. The second layout is fast-paced, loading the users directly into the form rather than the homepage. Here is an example <a href ="https://quicknote.io/">QuickNote<a>.

I have also designed a layout for how the database will function and look.

As shown on the image, it will include  a primary key and foreign key. This will show how the information and data will be stored.

> After showing my client and explaining what information it will, or could hold. She suggested to have more data types/variables like forename, surname, username and etc to make it easier to identify the user and making the variables "clearer."

After having the conversation with the end-user I started working, researching what information will be needed and how to effectively arrange it, hopefully making it "Clearer."

### 24/05/2024

After reviewing my DataBase I decided to improve it with a better version.

Currently I have added a view more variables and named it appropriately. I added username, password, forename, surname and date to the table, while also organizing it.

> The end-user is happy from with the improvement version.

Ill also need to add a hash
