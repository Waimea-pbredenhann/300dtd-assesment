# Design of a Database-Driven Web Application for NCEA Level 3

Project Name: **DueDay Manager**

Project Author: **Phillip Bredenhann**

Assessment Standards: **91902** and **91903**

-------------------------------------------------

## System Requirements

### Identified Need or Problem

Many students struggle to keep track of their assignments and assessments, especially during midterms when they have multiple assignments with different due dates. My website aims to provide a solution by offering an easy way for students to input and track their homework and assessment, helping them stay organized.

### End-User Requirements

The average student can vary in their experience in technology. This means that work DueDay Manger should use clear and simple language that can be easily understood.

Since the website will be used to jolt down due dates, the interface has to be slick, smooth, and easy to use, preferably faster than using a notebook.

Additionally. the function of making individual accounts to keep the users information private and secure. Able to login into their account with all their data saved.

### Proposed Solution

A website or app that is used by students to easily record and input due dates of their assessments or assignments to keep track of their progress.

The website should be able to:

- create labels, tasks and record dates.
- Shows the due date.
- Logging into the correct accounts

 Additionally the website should be:

- Able to sort from newest to oldest. 
- Shows different indications of how close the due date is.  
- Having the list update without a refresh. 
- Saving their previous information.

## Relevant Implications

### Social Implications

Social Implications involves how it affects the users when using the website.

Involving Social Implications its possible to prevent any misrepresentation of groups, people and more. Using it with the website we would also be able will also prevent any offence and stigmatising through the website.

Using Social Implication in the website I would have to use neutral language to not give off the wrong impression of a male/female dominated website. There wont be any racism or sexist language or imagery to avoid promoting any negative activity that could offend someone.

### Usability Implications

Usability Implications refer how easy it is for the end-user to use, without needing help or guidance.

Ensuring that the end user can easily navigate the website, regardless of age, youthfulness (to a certain extent), or experience, can significantly impact the website's usability implications and whether the user will choose to use the website or not.

When moving forward with this project, I'll need to apply 
<a href="https://dt.waimea.school.nz/help/design/ux/usability.php" target="_blank">Usability Heuristics</a> following the standard layout and logic similar of an everyday website. By addressing common usability considerations such as menus, scroll bars, and others, it will be easier for the end-user to adapt.

### Aesthetic Implications

Aesthetic Implications is how good, fancy or simple the website looks in terms of design.

The importance of aesthetic implications lies in their appeal for attracting and retaining users. A visually appealing design makes the website appear clean, easier to navigate, and expresses its goals through color, font size, and background images. 

Having design implications in the website, I would need to maintain a consistent color theme and design throughout. Ensuring that the colors complement each other and avoid any elements that may cause visual discomfort will be essential to prevent creating an eyesore.

-------------------------------------------------

## Relevant User Experience (UX) Principles

### Consistency and Standards

The consistency and standards are the consistent themes or similar elements being used throughout the entire website or repeated from other websites, making it familiar to the end-user in general.

Consistency and Standards are relevant because it will make the website look better and more manageable for the user. If the user has experience or not, they should be able to identify the menu, help screens and conformation buttons with the use of Consistency and Standards. This familiarity makes the user's experience much smoother.

Moving forward with consistency and standards, I'll have to compare and contrast different websites for a standard that the users are most likely used to. It would also require consistent themes such as color for the action button, arrangements, layout, and other elements.

### Error Prevention

Error Prevention refers to the measures or methods used to reduce or eliminate the user's errors without making it challenging for them.

In the use of Error Prevention, users' errors will become less frequent throughout the website. By predicting common errors and designing interfaces to mitigate them, users can interact with the website more effectively and smoothly.

Having to identify errors within the website's design and functionality. It may involve users testing the website for any areas where the users might struggle or make mistakes. There will also be error messages and notifications of errors. By reducing errors, it will improve the user's experience.

### Aesthetic and Minimalist Design

Aesthetic and Minimalist Design involves creating visually pleasing interfaces that are simple and uncluttered, focusing on the essential elements while eliminating all the unnecessary distractions. Using clean layouts, clear texts, clear fonts and pleasantly designed whitespace and color theme.

The design elements and visual components of the website are key factors to Aesthetic and Minimalist design. Having only necessary content, information or text shown can improve the minimalist design. Whilst having the aesthetic be consistent thought the website.

Designing a few concepts of the possible layout and choosing one that looks good or will fit the website better. The need for researching color will be important because it will define the mood, tone, and overall design of the website.

## Review and Evaluation

### Meeting the Needs of the Users

Replace this text with a brief evaluation of how well you met the needs of your users. Look at what you initially wrote about who they are, what specific needs they have, etc. and discuss how well the system meets those needs.

### Meeting the System Requirements
